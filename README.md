# viewport-glitcher

[Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/viewport-glitcher/onacloncedplghlhddcofmdccfejhipd) which takes a screenshot of current viewport, glitches it, and opens the result in a new tab. 

Uses [glitch-canvas](https://github.com/snorpey/glitch-canvas).

## TODO

Ideas: 

- Let user drag and select a portion of the viewport to screenshot and glitch
- Right-click on an element/picture in the browser to glitch
- Save the file instead of opening in a new tab?
