# Glitchy Glitch Gloo
Hi and welcome to my super cute and fun browser extension for making glitches! I used [zky829's Viewport Glitcher](https://github.com/zky829/viewport-glitcher/) as a base and added code of my own to align to my project. My browser extension uses the libraries glitch-canvas and p5. By clicking the browser icon the extension takes a screenshot of your tab and glitches both image and text elements.
